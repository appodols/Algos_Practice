Psuedocode:
  1--card is an object
    object contains value for suit, and rank
  2--deck is represented by an Array
  3--how would I subclass the datastructure?
    optimal value method that changes rank of aces
  1--one thing we are struggling with her is figuring out what exactly these questions
  and how much detail to provide
  1...deck--has def shuffle which allows randomizes the order of the element in the array
  hit--which gives a card to a player, and conversely subtracts from the deck

This answer was broken up the following way
  1. hand was an object
    a. is an array list of cards
  2. card is an object
    a. containing value and suit, and a boolean as to whether it is available
  3. constants are card types
  4. finally deck of cards exist
    a. you can shuffle cards
    b. deal them
