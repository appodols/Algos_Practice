1. Would have multiple databases for reading the file
First---what matters in our approach here?
  1. Ease of use for client
  2. ease of use for ourselves
  3. flexible and allows for future adapation

1. Keep data in TXT files, and let clients download all the data
    Pro of this is that it is simple--con is that it would be quite difficult
    to query through this data

2.  Use a SQL database.  Allows clients to do data querying so that they can get one
stock.  Gives us certain tools via inserting and updating.  Cons--provides more features than we need
ineffecient queries of one server would slow down the server and make it difficult for other users...perhaps
providing a UI with a set of limited queries would ensure the stability of this process

3. XML is easy to format and read/parse for both humans and computers.  Adding additional data to XML
  disadvatanges--harder to query, sends clients all file

4.
