3.1

I could use a single array to implement 3 stacks via just having 3 different heads
and tails pointers and having a nil element that would partition it

#Questions
  Can I have nil elements setup?
  do I have access to the stacks?
  can the arrays resize?

We need more detail...


You only need 2 basic things
  an array of values to represent the stacks
  and an array of sizes to represent the size of the stacks
  we keep stack capacity as a constant
